# Recommendation System Homework 1 - Evaluation Metrics

## Overview

This homework focuses on evaluating recommender systems using various performance metrics. You will explore the MovieLens 100K dataset, implement evaluation techniques, and analyze their effectiveness in assessing recommendation models. The assignment serves as a foundation for Homework 2, where you will develop and optimize matrix factorization-based recommendation models.

## Key Topics Covered

- MovieLens 100K dataset exploration
- Evaluation metrics for recommender systems
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - Precision@K and Recall@K
  - Coverage and Diversity
  - NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
- Comparison of different evaluation metrics
- Discussion on biases and limitations of metrics

## Python Version & Libraries Used

- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `numpy` - for numerical computations
  - `pandas` - for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` - for visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - for evaluation metrics

## Implementation Details

- **Dataset**: MovieLens 100K dataset containing user-item ratings.
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding rating distributions and user behaviors.
- **Metric Implementation**: Computing RMSE, MAE, and ranking-based metrics.
- **Analysis**: Comparing model performance across different metrics.

## Results & Analysis

- Interpretation of various evaluation metrics.
- Comparison of error-based and ranking-based evaluation methods.
- Discussion on practical implications for real-world recommendation systems.
